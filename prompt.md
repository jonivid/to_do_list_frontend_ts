### üöÄ To-Do App Expansion Project Plan: TypeScript Deep Dive

Since your goal is to **gain TypeScript experience**, we will take an iterative approach to expanding your To-Do app. Each stage will introduce new TypeScript concepts and challenges, building on what you already know. This project will focus on TypeScript best practices, complex type definitions, React patterns, and optimizations.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Project Goals**

- Refactor and extend your existing To-Do app using TypeScript.
- Introduce new features with a focus on TypeScript type safety.
- Expose you to advanced TypeScript scenarios, including generics, utility types, discriminated unions, and context typing.
- Optimize the app with performance improvements using React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo.
- Implement state persistence with localStorage and type-safe data handling.

### üó∫Ô∏è **Overall Roadmap**

1. **Stage 1: Refactor Existing Code for Stronger Type Safety**
   - Refactor current components and hooks to use advanced TypeScript features.
   - Add stricter types, including union types, utility types, and enums.
   - Ensure all functions, hooks, and context are type-safe.

2. **Stage 2: Add Subtasks Functionality**
   - Extend the existing task type to support subtasks.
   - Implement a nested To-Do structure using complex types.
   - Refactor components and hooks to handle the new subtask feature.

3. **Stage 3: Implement Task Filters and Sorting**
   - Add filtering capabilities (e.g., by status, priority, due date).
   - Use enums and union types for filter options.
   - Add sorting options for tasks, and explore TypeScript‚Äôs utility types for better type safety.

4. **Stage 4: Persist Tasks with LocalStorage**
   - Introduce data persistence using localStorage.
   - Use TypeScript type assertions and guards to handle data retrieval and parsing.
   - Create a utility function with generics for type-safe localStorage handling.

5. **Stage 5: Analytics and Task Insights**
   - Add a feature to display analytics, such as total tasks, completed tasks, and overdue tasks.
   - Use TypeScript for type-safe calculations and data transformations.
   - Introduce `useMemo` for memoizing expensive calculations.

6. **Stage 6: Drag-and-Drop Task Reordering**
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality using a library like `react-beautiful-dnd`.
   - Type the drag-and-drop handlers and components.
   - Use TypeScript generics for handling dynamic data.

7. **Stage 7: Theming and Dark Mode**
   - Add a dark mode toggle using React Context.
   - Type the context and theme objects with TypeScript.
   - Ensure the entire app respects the theme using TypeScript for type-safe styling.

### üå± **Detailed Prompt Structure for Each Stage**

For each stage, I will:
1. **Provide an Overview**: Explain what we are doing in the current stage and why.
2. **Outline TypeScript Concepts**: Highlight specific TypeScript features we‚Äôll focus on.
3. **Step-by-Step Guide**: Break down the tasks into smaller steps with clear explanations.
4. **Code Examples**: Provide code snippets with detailed annotations for TypeScript learning.

### üìù **How to Use This Plan**

You can simply say, "Let‚Äôs start with Stage 1," and I‚Äôll give you a detailed breakdown of the tasks, TypeScript concepts, and step-by-step coding instructions for that stage. After we complete a stage, we can move on to the next one.

### üöÄ **Summary of Completed Stage: React Context Refactor with TypeScript Enhancements**

In this stage, we successfully refactored your To-Do app, transitioning to a more scalable and type-safe architecture using **React Context** and advanced TypeScript features. This refactor eliminated prop drilling and improved overall code quality. Here‚Äôs a summary of what we accomplished and a roadmap for the next stages.

### üìù **Summary of Changes:**

1. **Refactored State Management with React Context:**
   - We created two contexts: `TaskStateContext` and `TaskActionsContext` to separate state and actions, improving maintainability and reducing unnecessary re-renders.
   - Implemented custom hooks (`useTaskState` and `useTaskActions`) to safely consume context values with proper TypeScript typing.

2. **Updated TypeScript Configuration:**
   - Enhanced `tsconfig.json` to support project references, composite builds, and proper JSX handling.
   - Added `"composite": true` and `"incremental": true` for efficient incremental builds.
   - Removed invalid compiler options (`noUncheckedSideEffectImports`), fixing build errors and aligning with TypeScript best practices.

3. **Refactored Components:**
   - **TaskForm**: Simplified by using `useTaskActions` from context, removed prop dependencies, and improved type safety with enum handling (`TaskPriority`).
   - **TaskItem**: Replaced prop drilling with context consumption, and simplified state updates using context actions.
   - **TaskList**: Refactored to consume `useTaskState`, making it cleaner and more efficient.
   - **HomePage**: Updated to use context hooks (`useTaskState` and `useTaskActions`), aligning with the new context-based architecture.
   - **App**: Wrapped the entire app in `TaskProvider`, ensuring global access to task state and actions.

4. **Improved TypeScript Usage:**
   - Leveraged TypeScript features like **enums**, **union types**, **Partial<T>**, and **utility types** for type-safe operations.
   - Refined custom hook typings with generics and type guards to enhance type inference and prevent runtime errors.

5. **Build and Type Check:**
   - Cleaned and rebuilt the TypeScript project using `npx tsc --build --clean` and `npx tsc --build`.
   - Resolved all TypeScript errors, ensuring a fully type-safe codebase.

### üõ†Ô∏è **What‚Äôs Next: Roadmap for Upcoming Stages**

Now that we have a solid foundation with React Context and TypeScript, we can increase the complexity of the app with new features and optimizations.

#### **Stage 2: Add Subtasks Functionality**
- **Extend Task Type**: Update the `Task` type to support nested subtasks.
- **UI Update**: Modify `TaskItem` to display subtasks with a collapsible view.
- **Recursive State Management**: Implement recursive state updates for handling nested subtasks.

#### **Stage 3: Implement Task Filters and Sorting**
- **Add Filters**: Introduce task filters (e.g., by status, priority, due date).
- **Sorting Options**: Allow sorting tasks by different criteria (e.g., priority, creation date).
- **Type-Safe Enum and Union Types**: Use enums and union types to define filter and sorting options.

#### **Stage 4: Persist Tasks with LocalStorage**
- **LocalStorage Integration**: Save tasks in LocalStorage to persist state across page reloads.
- **Custom Hook with Type Safety**: Create a custom hook for LocalStorage interactions, ensuring type-safe data handling.

#### **Stage 5: Analytics and Insights**
- **Task Analytics**: Display insights (e.g., total tasks, completed tasks, overdue tasks).
- **Performance Optimizations**: Use `useMemo` for memoizing expensive calculations.

#### **Stage 6: Drag-and-Drop Task Reordering**
- **Drag-and-Drop Library**: Integrate a library like `react-beautiful-dnd` for task reordering.
- **Type-Safe Handlers**: Type the drag-and-drop handlers with TypeScript generics.

#### **Stage 7: Theming and Dark Mode**
- **Theme Context**: Create a React Context for theming (light mode, dark mode).
- **Styled Components**: Ensure the entire app respects the theme using styled components or CSS variables.
